## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Box Model
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project made me explore more on CSS box-model and how to use its properties like margin and padding.
```css
.card{margin-left:auto;
    margin-right:auto;
    margin-top:20vh;
    padding:15px;}```

I also explored the box-shadow property and the various attributes of it.

```css
.card{
    box-shadow: 0px 6px 10px hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
```

### Continued development

I am planning to work more on Responsiveness of Websites along with usage of media queries.

### Useful resources
